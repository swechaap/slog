**SLOG - Swecha Log System**

**Project Overview :**
The SLOG (Swecha Log) system is an innovative e-logging solution designed to efficiently monitor the entry (IN) and exit (OUT) flow of students and visitors at the Swecha Learning Center (SLC) of our college. This system streamlines attendance tracking by automating the process of recording student IDs via scanning and storing the data in a centralized database.

**Key Features :**

  Automated ID Scanning: The system utilizes RFID or QR code scanning to capture student IDs quickly and accurately, ensuring that every entry and exit is logged in real-time.
  
  Database Management: All scanned data is securely transmitted to a server, where it is stored in a structured database. This enables easy retrieval and management of attendance records.
  
  User Management: Administrators can easily add, remove, and update student records through a user-friendly web interface. This feature ensures that the database remains current and relevant.
  
  Customizable Reporting: The system provides robust reporting capabilities, allowing users to generate attendance reports based on various criteria such as name, department, and month. Reports can be tailored for individual students or aggregated for entire groups.
  
  Real-Time Monitoring: The system enables real-time monitoring of student attendance, providing insights into attendance patterns and helping to identify any issues related to student engagement.
  
**Technical Details :**

  Technology Stack: The project is built using a full-stack development approach, incorporating technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and PHP and MySQL for the backend. The system leverages IoT devices for scanning and logging attendance.
  
  User Interface: The web application is designed to be intuitive and responsive, ensuring ease of use for both students and administrators. The interface provides easy navigation for managing records and generating reports.
  
  Security Measures: The system includes authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized personnel can access and manage the database.
  
**Benefits :**

  Enhanced Efficiency: By automating attendance tracking, the SLOG system reduces administrative burdens and minimizes human errors associated with manual logging.
  
  Data Accessibility: The centralized database allows for quick access to attendance records, making it easier to analyze trends and prepare reports for stakeholders.
  
  Improved Engagement: By monitoring attendance, the system helps ensure that students are actively participating in the learning environment, enabling timely interventions if needed.

**Steps to Set Up the Project :**

1.Prepare the Circuit:

  Ensure all components are connected correctly according to the wiring diagram.
  
2.Install Required Libraries:

  Make sure you have all necessary libraries installed in the Arduino IDE for uploading the code to the NodeMCU.
  
3.Clone the Project:

  Clone the project repository from the GitHub repository.
  
4.Set Up Project Folder:

  For Linux Users: Place the project folder (slog) in the path /var/www/html on your localhost or server.
  
  For Windows Users: Set up a local server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, Apache Tomcat) and place the project folder in the server's directory.
  
5.Install Server Requirements:

  Ensure you have phpMyAdmin, MySQL, and PHP installed and configured on your system.
  
6.Update Code Configuration:

  Modify the necessary details in the code, including the server IP address, file paths, and hotspot SSID and password to match your network settings.
  
**How It Works :** 

1.Network Connection:

  When the NodeMCU connects to the specified SSID, it should be on the same network as the localhost server. If using a hotspot, ensure it provides internet access.
  
2.RFID Scanning:

  When an ID card is presented to the RFID reader, the NodeMCU sends a request for the corresponding details to the server.
  
3.Data Handling:

  The sendid.php file processes the RFID data, storing it in the database and retrieving the necessary information.
  
  The getcount.php file retrieves the total count of visitors for reporting purposes.
